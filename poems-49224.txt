
 That Halloween I wore your wedding dress,  our children spooked & wouldn’t speak for days.  I’d razored taut calves smooth, teased each blown tress,  then—lipsticked, mascaraed, & self-amazed—  shimmied like a starlet on the dance floor.  I’d never felt so sensual before—  Catholic schoolgirl & neighborhood whore.  In bed, dolled up, undone, we fantasized:  we clutched & fused, torn twins who’d been denied.  You were my shy groom. Love, I was your bride.
