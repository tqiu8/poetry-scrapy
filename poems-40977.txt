 It's been two thousand years now that, with a wounded leg,   the god's amazing loves have dragged along.   He has aged. Soon   he won't be noticed except from way up in a plane   in the markings of wheat   that yield the trace   of an ancient sanctuary.   He solicits a language of caresses,   open pasture, available bodies,   and the words refuse, and this elsewhere is already in his death   except for a slender purple flower under the sun.   He can still act the god all around,   evening's worn heart.   He guesses the flower will slip   fragile   from one century to the next with its prayer.
